# Insufficient Error Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: inadequate error handling in asynchronous operations. The provided code uses `http.get` to fetch data from an API. While a `try-catch` block is present, error handling is limited to printing the error message to the console, which is not sufficient for production-ready applications.

The `bug.dart` file shows the original code with insufficient error handling. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a more robust solution.

## Bug:
The bug lies in the insufficient error handling within the `fetchData` function.  Simply printing the error message to the console is not enough for robust error management.  A more comprehensive solution is needed for logging, user feedback, and potentially retry mechanisms.

## Solution:
The solution involves improving the error handling by providing more specific error messages, implementing better logging, and potentially handling specific error types differently.
